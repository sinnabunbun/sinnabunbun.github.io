This was me every time we started talking about stats analysis, defiantly should've refreshed my nonexistent stats education.
<br><br>
What did I _not_ learn in this class? Despite struggling with some of the topics, I really loved learning to code. I have never had such an open-ended experience with math, there were so many was to solve the same problem which really appeals to me!

### What were you asked to do?

***

I think for the next two question I will break it down based of the course objectives and some of the quotes from the course overview. I'll go more into depth on what I felt each outcome means and how I felt I completed them.


1. Scientific Inquiry: "Identifying and applying appropriate methods of statistical inference to test hypotheses related to biological anthropology"  

- This was one of the primary learning outcomes of the course and I think this really came through in the homeworks and challenges from the modules.

- I think one of my favorite hw assignments, the zombies, was a great turning point for me. I looked at my earlier code like from homework in [week 2](https://github.com/sinnabunbun/AN588-Week-2-martah/blob/main/martah_FinalHomeworkCode_01.Rmd) and I was not confident in my skills and my commenting. I say that zombies was the turning point because its when I felt the most creative and capable (and I think for loops have been the most fun method we've learned this semester). This also had what I think was my most original homework [code](https://github.com/sinnabunbun/AN588_Zombies_martah/blob/main/martah_OriginalHomeworkCode_03.Rmd) up until this point. 

- Also part of inquiry was researching the packages necessary for effective statistical interference. Out of curiosity, I had a look through my win-library folder where all my packages are stored and there was 250! Granted I didn't download all of those myself, but I really enjoyed the approach of just approaching a problem from all angles until something sticks! I think this demonstrates this objective because inquiry is all about testing hypotheses, and even with my package research I displayed this skill. Now I just have to figure out how to get rid of some of them :)


2. Quantitative Reasoning: "Using the R statistical programming framework, students will explore the underlying logic and mathematics of probability, hypothesis testing, linear modeling and regression, ANOVA, multiple regression, generalized linear modeling and mixed effects modeling, and then use these methods to solve complex problems in biological anthropology with both real and simulated data."

- I think I'm most proud of this in my final project. To me, quantitative has to do with the actual analysis of the data, not just understanding the process of coding like above. By working with an actual dataset that I had to run inference on, I had first hand experience with data replication. I specifically choose the Betti et al. [article](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2018.1807) because I was writing a paper on the subject in another class. By calculating and comparing the indices of the different planes of the pelvis I had a better practical understanding of my own paper subject. From this, I had first hand experience of how statistical modeling can help deepen understanding of a subject for further analysis. 

- My sample that best represents this outside of the project was the final homework where we had to write our own code for the formula. That required an understanding of not only how to use functions but how those functions are built so we could do it on our own. I had a lot of help from my peers, but overall I felt my contribution to the [assignment](https://github.com/sinnabunbun/AN588_Boots_martah/blob/main/martah_OriginalHWCode_05.Rmd) was substantial.


3. Teamwork/Collaboration: "Students will engage in bi-weekly Peer Commentary assignments in which they must collaborate in shared GitHub repositories to share, annotate, and comment on each othersâ€™ coding-based homework assignments." 

- This was a really important outcome of the course, teamwork over a  virtual medium is incredibly tricky I have discovered. Using the supplemental readings from the beginning of the course plus my own trial and error helped me understand why teamwork is essential on any large scale coding projects.  

- Looking back at my first coding assignment, I didn't even realize how to properly critique or comment on my own [code](https://github.com/sinnabunbun/AN588-Week-2-martah/blob/main/martah_OriginalHomeworkCode_01.Rmd)! Working with other classmates really  helped me improve my techniques and my understanding of making my thought process accessible. It also helped seeing other people's work to see that I was not, in fact, the only confused person in the class as I had previously thought. Great confused college students solidarity in that respect.


4. Replication: "Know how to design and implement reproducible data science workflows that take a project from data acquisition to analysis to presentation and be able to organize your work using a version control system. Be able to accurately assess, critique, and reproduce existing published works utilizing public and open source data repositories and analytical techniques"

- This was most evident in the final project. i think I fairly assessed the work of the authors as well as learned more about the importance of creating replicable data. I'm really unfamiliar with data sharing in the professional sense so discovering Dryad and FigShare was bizarre for me. I didn't really understand why data wasn't openly available, so now I realize why getting closer to having open access is important.  

- Learning about what makes research good or bad helps with my critique of science articles but also helps me prepare for future work in the field. If I want to continue using R, this course has taught me the importance of notating my process and including data in my work as much as possible.

### What did you accomplish?

***

1. I feel I accomplished the scientific inquiry objectives very well. I actively participated in discussion both inside the classroom and amongst my peers outside the class. As I have already pointed out, I put a lot of effort into discovering and understanding new packages, and despite many of which I decided weren't actually useful to the current projects, I hope that I get to use them again in the future.

2. I feel I accomplished the quantitative reasoning objectives moderately well. I will admit I still have trouble understanding the complex programs and statistical analysis we covered later in the course. My topics for the final and the data replication didn't cover mixed models or multiple regression so I feel less comfortable with those than I do to the earlier concepts of the course. If I continue to use R in the future I think I will need to go back and re-address these concepts so I can have a more complete understanding of complex analysis. 

3. I feel I accomplished the teamwork objectives very well. This has been the area of most growth for me. I think originally I was really nervous to engage with others and work in groups but over the course of the semester I have become much more comfortable. Most of this took place outside of R, but as I have pointed out, you can see the improvement in both my own notation and my critiques on others' code. By the end of the year I am able to confidently engage with peers over critiques and collaboration, which was a goal of mine for the semester.

4. I feel I accomplished the replication objectives very well. I have been extremely pleased with the results of my data replication. Some of the graphs were really daunting and I think they came out wonderful. I feel much more confident in my own work and being able to critique well reviewed science literature. I also think being able to use these statistical inferences outside of R by expanding it to and external paper is very impressive, I'm very proud of that accomplishment.

### How well did you accomplish them?

***

I feel that I accomplished all of the activities even more so than I was initially expecting of myself. I think I came into this course with not the best mindset coming off of not being a student for almost a whole year and jumping straight into an unfamiliar high level course was defiantly stressful. I am a little embarrassed to admit that I can in expecting to not do well, but in some ways I think the pushed me to put in more effort. 

The feeling that I was in a bit over my head prompted me to ask lots of questions both inside and outside of class. I think that was what I excelled at, I approached everything with an open mind which I think is what lead me to really liking coding. The open-endedness of the code really appealed to my creative side. Even though it wasn't always productive, I really enjoyed searching through packages and parameters of commands to try and maximize the usefulness of certain commands.

That being said there were defiantly some practical things I struggled with. I very much underestimated how long certain tasks would take and more than once stayed up way longer than I thought I would trying to fix a problem in my code. I think the more comfortable I become with code, the better I will be able to meet deadlines, since I have a better idea of how long certain tasks will take. For example, I figured understanding all commands associated with packages would take maybe 10 minutes tops which is wildly incorrect. I think Rdocumentation is great but its not exactly user friendly so its a lot of messing with random arguments and googling. Now that I know that I can properly secion off an hour or so to reading a package documentation and messing with it before getting into its uses within my code.

I defiantly saw improvement over the course of the semester! I think all aspects of my code improved, starting with the most basic in notation. I really didn't understand how to properly annotate my code at the beginning or contribute to my partners code, but now I feel really confident in my opinions and explanations (although I still think I need to expand my vocab, I still have trouble explaining things and correctly wording my questions). Coming into this with virtually no knowledge of code or stats was really daunting, but now I realize that meant there was no way but up for me! I think I still really rely on info in the modules but I'm getting better every time I work in R with remembering concepts and coming up with solutions on my own.

### How has your understanding of and approach to statistics and project design changed since taking this course?

***

This has completely changed my ideas based on project design and especially statistics. I'll go more in depth in the peer section but project design to me has allows been 'divide and conquer'. As somewhat of a control freak it was hard to take a backseat in some of the projects because I simply was not at the same level of some of my peers. Instead of splitting up work and coming back together, I needed to learn how to work _truly_ collaboratively with other people. This wasn't just in the final project either. In reflecting on the semester I realized that I went from separately working on Peer Commentaries to insisting on Zoom meetings, to meeting in person for the final homework.  

Also, my process for project design has totally changed, that was mostly from the final project. I think you can get away with specializing in one or two section of a project in other fields but defiantly not in statistics. I learned that every member has to be involved and communicative during every stage of the project in order to come up with something good and cohesive.

<br><br><br>

### What did you learn from all this?

***

1. I learned practically and theoretically what coding is. I feel comfortable with understanding code which helps me understand how it can be used for problem solving. Before this class, I was vaguely aware that websites were 'built' on code but I didn't really understand what code was. By building projects from the ground up, I now understand the process better. This includes all of the work we did as a class to engineer formulas and for loops from scratch (that was really helpful) All the way up to project design for our vignette.

2. Ideas are what matters not content. OK, that's not entirely true but i will address this later on as well. It was discouraging to spend so much time on something and then have it not work or end up getting scraped. I think this process has taught me o analyze what worked and what didn't and move forward. I tend to get hung up on failure so I think this was a great lesson for me personally.

3. How to problem solve. Granted, I like to think I had a little bit of this before AN588 but this course certainly helped. I had CS friends tell me that coding is basically problem solving, to which I would always reply that they were fooling themselves into liking math (also kind of true tbh). But.... they were right! The majority of coding is not being great at math or statistics, its being good at understanding what the general idea of the missing link is in your analysis instead of the exact solution. You may need to get from A to B but if you aren't comfortable thinking of other ways besides a straight line, you will run into problems in coding almost immediately.

### What did your learn about teamwork in this course? How did the readings on teamwork foster this understanding? How did the teamwork experiences?

***


I think early on in the semester the readings and Modules on gitHub were very helpful for modeling a workflow for R using gitHub. The shortcoming of this is I think the fact that we didn't get to practice it much. I think the branching method would have been really helpful for the group project at the end of the semester but we weren't really comfortable with the set up so we didn't use it (mistake). I think creating new markdowns in a cloned repo was super helpful for commentaries on other people's code so I like how we did that but I wish we had more experience with group collaboration. Since we were comfortable with individual markdowns, our team had 'workspaces' in our repo (mine is very much a mess if you want to try and understand the chaos of my thought [process](https://github.com/sinnabunbun/Super-Fly-Group-Module/blob/main/Marta.Rmd)) that we combined in the main project. This lead to overwrites and a lot of confusion that we only really worked out at the end of the process, when we started communicating more and working together.
In terms of reading, I think some of the articles from very early on about teamwork and how to review code were really encouraging. One that we didn't talk about in class, [Hello World!](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/HelloWorldEbook.pdf) was actually one of my favorites. There was an article included in it on being a women in a male lead field that I really enjoyed. It had valuable insights on teamwork, but even more so it made me feel encouraged. I think a lot of our teamwork exercises served the same purpose, which was really helpful. :)

### How did the Peer Commentary process and Group Project relate, if at all, to what you view as your successes or difficulties in this course?

***


Immensely I would say! The peer commentary parts of the assignments were great, it really helped with not only my code but my confidence. The coding part was enhanced by my peers because talking through problems is especially helpful for me and is something that I feel a lot of college courses are missing. I appreciate professor and TA/LA/CPT/etc. feedback on assignments in my classes but I think discussing with people who are also learning the content at the same time is really helpful. Also, I felt my peers were really creative, everyone had such interesting solutions for problems and I loved getting to talk with them and see their process.

I definitely was anxious around upper classmen, especially since I felt many of them were much more advanced in their studies, research, and honestly just general intellect. I think that imposter feeling is something a lot of students struggle with and by not only encouraging but enabling discussions outside of class, I felt more encouraged in my work. I was shocked to find that not only was my code comparable to my classmates, but actually I got to help others and explain my process. Getting compliments on my own coding and helping others that originally had intimidated me was a really great experience for me personally.

I also really enjoyed the group project. It was defiantly a little more difficult than the commentaries since it was a collaborative project. I think it taught me to be better with team work, and especially adaptability in group projects. There were very discouraging points were I would work on code for hours only to have it not work or not be included in the final project which was stressful. I didn't really realize until the end that its not necessarily the code that's important but the ideas. I felt like I wasn't helpful because my code didn't make it in some sections, but that wasn't really the case. I have never really worked on projects where 'divide and conquer' wasn't an option, in this we all had to be in communication about all aspects of the project so we knew what problems needed addressing and even more importantly so we didn't overwrite other people's code (that happened so much oh my gosh, very stressful, don't recommend). Overall though, I think its a very helpful lesson, I have more ideas from this experience to improve collaborative projects in the future!

### What, if anything, of lasting value do you take away from this experience? If nothing, what would you do differently if you were to start over in this course? 

***

I took away so much from this course! If it wasn't obvious by my gif of choice, math is not my strong suit and I had never taken statistics prior to this course. I also had only experienced coding via html editing on wattpad (eeks). I feel really confident now though, and it's not that I understand everything about R which was originally what I though I wanted out of the course. Instead I have the valuable skill of creatively thinking outside the box. I now know how to understand the problems I'm running into with the code and how I can try to understand them either through targeted searches, exploring the package commands, looking at vignettes, or asking peers. It's such an open-ended project, there can be dozens of solution to the same problem which I have now learned to love. I think that more than anything this lesson has been invaluable as a learning experience. 

Now, that isn't to say I don't feel I learned anything about R. I am really satisfied with my understanding of base R as well as how to search for and use different packages. I have substantially expanded my vocabulary and I feel like I'm better equipped to discuss coding with others. I hope I can use this knowledge in research using R and also expanding into other languages. I think now that I have a better understanding of just what coding is and how statistical tests work, I can tackle some other languages to expand my reach!
